dev:

In the index.html file I added only value attributes to the input element.
I started my work by creating a function (paintChannelList) that renders page elements. I couldn't use the data fetch from the channels.json file, so I copied it manually to a js script file and saved it to a variable as an array. Then using js I added page elements such as js logos and buttons. Later I took care of the style of the header element and rendered channels. I implemented a function that reverses the colors on the page, and then added to the button that reverses those colors.
Then it was time to style the arrangement of the content in the rendered elements of the main section. Później stworzyłem funkcję sortowania elementów według kategorii wprowadzonych w elementach radiowych. Later, I created a function to sort elements by categories entered in radio elements. The clear button deletes the sorting and checking in the input fields.
